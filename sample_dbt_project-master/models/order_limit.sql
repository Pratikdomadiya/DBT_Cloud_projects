/*
Custom generic tests:

Test : order limit not exceed to 500
NOTE : To add this test into production , add configuration in schema.yaml file.

letâ€™s say the business requires that we have no orders for over 500 units, as the company cannot fulfill such large orders with current inventory levels. This is the perfect use case for customer generic tests.
